NAME : ATHARVA JAGTAP DOMAIN : DATA ANALYTICS ID :CT08IIR COMPANY : CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS DURATION : JAN TO FEB 2025

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT : EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

OBEJECTIVE To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and implement a Linear Regression Model using the Diabetes Dataset. Analyze the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships between features to predict a continuous target variable effectively.

KEY FEATURES :

EDA Analysis: Visualizations of distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables. Regression Modeling: Selection of a key feature (BMI) to predict the target variable. Model training, testing, and performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). Visualization Tools: Histograms for feature distribution. Heatmap for correlations. Scatter plots for predictions vs actual values.

TECHNLOGY USED :

Technologies Used: Python - Programming language. Libraries: NumPy - Numerical operations. Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn - Data visualization. Scikit-learn - Machine learning tools (data splitting, modeling, and evaluation).
